# Laboratory Work on the Topic: "Cyclic Iterations"

This project provides utilities for performing cyclic iterations in C++. It includes functions for calculating iterations, performing element-wise operations (such as checking for convergence and counting iterations), and displaying iteration results in a user-friendly format.

## Features:

- Perform cyclic iterations for solving equations.
- Track the number of iterations and check for convergence.
- Display iteration results in a neat, formatted output.

## Setup:

- git clone https://github.com/zhurak-v/iterative-loops.git
- run build-and-run.sh

## Usage:

The program prompts the user to input the initial values for cyclic iterations, then performs iterations to find the solution. It also checks for convergence and outputs the results of each iteration until the solution is found or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
